# AR-ioECOG-Pose-Estimation

## Overview  
This repository contains the inference pipeline for markerless EEG electrode localization using stereo video captured by the Microsoft HoloLens 2. It implements a multi-stage deep learning workflow including bounding box detection, super-resolution enhancement, keypoint detection, and 3D triangulation. Pose estimation is performed using a vision-based transformer regression model.

This codebase corresponds to the methods and experiments described in:
